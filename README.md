# Simple Calculator in Python

This Python script is a simple calculator that prompts the user for their name, two numbers, and an operation to perform on those numbers.

1. **User Input**: The code asks the user for their name, the first number (num1), the second number (num2), and the desired operation. It uses the `input` function to capture user input.

2. **Operation Selection**: The user can choose from four basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The selected operation is stored in the `operation` variable.

3. **Math Functions**: The script defines four functions for performing these operations: `addition`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `division`. These functions take two numbers as input and return the result of the respective operation.

4. **Performing the Operation**: Depending on the selected operation, the script calls the corresponding function and calculates the result.

5. **Handling Division by Zero**: If the user attempts division by zero, the script checks for this condition and provides an error message to prevent a ZeroDivisionError.

6. **Displaying the Result**: The script then displays a greeting using the user's name and the result of the chosen operation.

7. **Output**: The final result, along with the greeting, is printed to the console.

This code serves as a basic calculator .
